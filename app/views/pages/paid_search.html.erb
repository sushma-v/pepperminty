    <div class="col-xs-12 text-left">
      <p>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) is one of the most popular forms of advertising online. On the more popular search engines
        your advert is displayed in various places including the top, sides or display banners – you only pay when someone
        clicks on these ads.</p>
      <p><span class="secondary-color">Search advertising</span> is extremely targeted and refers to the sponsored results
        at the top of Google listings when a search query is run; when done right you can deliver instant and meaningful traffic.
        The keywords generated will mean your site only appears when people search for the words you select. The control
        is in your hands as you can decide specifically what you advertise, the times and place your ads show and also you
        control your daily budget. Paid search also encompasses <span class="secondary-color">display advertising</span>
        which is the textual or graphical adverts that are placed on 3rd party websites; and also
        <span class="secondary-color">remarketing</span> which allows you to target your ads to people that have visited your site already,
        allowing you to convert window shoppers to customers. </p>

        your site ranking and traffic at a high level. What's more, for any new advertisers to Google AdWords you can get a
